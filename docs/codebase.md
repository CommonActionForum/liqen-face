# Codebase structure

The directories of the App are:

- **/app**. This is the most important directory. It has almost all the code that is shared between server and client.
- **/server** has the code that is particular for server-side
- **/client** has the code that is particular for client-side.
- **/public** is the directory accessible from any request.

## Conventions

Any directory called **dist** (wherever they are) and its content is autogenerated. They are excluded from version control and are considered temporary directories.

Any directory called **lib** (wherever thay are) is considered to have helper functions if the kind of functions included in **lib** are different from the kind of functions of the container directory. For example, if a directory **/component** has *component* files and certain components needs a **fragment** function, that function should be in **/component/lib** because it is not a *component*.

There is no **test** directory. The test files should be in the same directory of the tested thing and its name should end with **.test.js**.
